# ethereum-block-explorer

## Project Setup

```sh
npm install
```

### Run the project locally

```sh
npm run dev

... then open https://localhost:3000/ in your browser to view the application.

Note that the url that appears in the console after running ```npm run dev``` might have a different port, in which case use that one instead.
